# Prime Gap Predictor (δ(E))

A predictive simulator of prime gaps δ(E) based on the asymptotic formula δ(E) = √E · loglog(E) / log(E), with correction for local prime density variation. Enter any even number E to compute both predicted and corrected δ(E) values. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Created by Bahbouhi Bouchaib, independent researcher, Nantes, France.
